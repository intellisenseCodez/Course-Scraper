Many of our excellent teaching staff are world leaders in their fields and a number are Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) authors and Fellows of the Royal Society. We also have a Regius Professor of Meteorology and Climate Science, and the University is one of only 19 institutes in the UK to have been awarded one of these prestigious positions by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth.Teaching is divided between lectures and practical work, but the ratio depends on options selected. You will have the opportunity to carry out a range of experiments using our extensive fluid dynamics and instrument labs, and atmospheric observatory. During your final year you will have the option of attending a summer field study trip; in recent years students have gone to the Lake District, but the location of the field class is subject to change. You will also complete an independent research project on a topic of your choice, perhaps focusing on the currents of hurricanes and typhoons or the effect of climate change on crops.This course is approved by the Royal Meteorological Society (RMetS) and is your first step towards becoming professionally accredited as either a Registered Meteorologist (RMet) or Chartered Meteorologist (CMet)."

Designed by Professor Ed Hawkins, the climate stripes present a compelling visualisation of how global temperatures have risen since the mid-19th century due to human-caused climate change. The stripes have been shared by the likes of Greta Thunberg and the United Nations, as well as thousands of others around the world.100% of our students said the course often challenges them to achieve their best work (National Student Survey 2024, responders from the Department of Meteorology).The University of Reading has been named Sustainable University of the Year in The Times and The Sunday Times Good University Guide 2025.Explore all aspects of meteorology and climate, including atmospheric science and oceanography, whilst learning from world-leading researchers. By taking BSc Meteorology and Climate at the University of Reading, you'll be joining a course of study approved by the Royal Meteorological Society. You'll also benefit from the Department's close links to industry and a range of opportunities to enhance your employability.As part of our small, specialist department, you will benefit from an enviable staff to student ratio. Many of our excellent teaching staff are world leaders in their fields and a number are Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) authors and Fellows of the Royal Society. We also have a Regius Professor of Meteorology and Climate Science, and the University is one of only 19 institutes in the UK to have been awarded one of these prestigious positions by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth.Teaching is divided between lectures and practical work, but the ratio depends on options selected. You will have the opportunity to carry out a range of experiments using our extensive fluid dynamics and instrument labs, and atmospheric observatory. During your final year you will have the option of attending a summer field study trip; in recent years students have gone to the Lake District, but the location of the field class is subject to change. You will also complete an independent research project on a topic of your choice, perhaps focusing on the currents of hurricanes and typhoons or the effect of climate change on crops.This course is approved by the Royal Meteorological Society (RMetS) and is your first step towards becoming professionally accredited as either a Registered Meteorologist (RMet) or Chartered Meteorologist (CMet)."
